The Silent Vengeance

Rather than leaving clues or patterns, Edgar's actions took a more silent and personal turn. He began targeting individuals who, in his mind, represented the root of his suffering. The victims, chosen for perceived wrongs against Edgar, disappeared without a trace. The town was left in a state of anxiety as the mysterious disappearances remained unexplained. Fear permeated the community as friends and family members wondered who would be the next to vanish, creating an atmosphere of dread and suspicion.
